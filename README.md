# CS-320-T3689: Software Testing Automation & QA

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Functionality and security of code can be best achieved by attempting to attack or break your code as if you were trying to either compromise its security or cause it to crash. Code must be tested vigorously and aggressively, as code that is favored or insufficently could result in the release of potentially unstable or insecure code into a production environment. Code should be reviewed by peers, statically checked via tools, and functionally tested to uncover these weaknesses. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs should be interpreted carefully, to vet for personal bias from the client, to ensure no personal bias of what the client is "actually" asking for or how to achieve it, and to ensure that none of the potential end-users that were consulted unduly used their perceived or actual power within the group of possible end-users to influence what is included in the specification. User needs should, after being checked for redundancy or extraneous functionalities, be presented to users for final evaluation and prioritization before requirements and functionalitiies are codified into a design document.

How do I approach designing software?
Software design should be done iteratively, achieving fixed and well-defined goals in short intervals, with development, testing, and user approval being achieved before moving on. Naturally, changes in requirements or functionality must be taken into account, and a well-developed engineering process will be flexible enough to change in response. Segments of usable code should be presented, and occasionally a piece of software made of the components necessary to a larger functionality should be tested and presented to the end-users to ensure the project is on track and in accordance with present goals.
